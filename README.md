Got it! Let's revise the README.md to reflect that DataMesh uses a graph-oriented approach for managing file tags and relationships rather than blockchain. Hereâ€™s an updated version:

## DataMesh

DataMesh is a decentralized file renting network that utilizes a graph-oriented approach to manage file storage and retrieval. Unlike traditional blockchain systems, DataMesh represents files and their metadata as nodes in a directed graph. This approach allows for efficient tagging, fragmentation, and retrieval of files in a decentralized environment.

## Features

- **Graph-Based Storage**: Utilizes a directed graph to manage file tags and relationships.
- **File Fragmentation**: Supports sharding and fragmentation of files across the network.
- **Decentralized Access**: Files are distributed across a network of nodes, with access governed by relationships in the graph.
- **Efficient Querying**: Leverages graph algorithms to efficiently query and retrieve fragmented files.
- **Integrated Testing Suite**: Comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and performance.
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and builds using [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/).
- **Code Coverage**: Detailed code coverage reports via [Codecov](https://codecov.io).

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourOrg/DataMesh.git
   cd DataMesh
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build
   cmake --build build
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   ./build/DataMesh --help
   ```

### Running Tests

To build and run the test suite, use the following commands:

```bash
cmake -S test -B build/test
cmake --build build/test
CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 cmake --build build/test --target test
```

### Code Formatting

Ensure your code adheres to the project's style guidelines using `clang-format` and `cmake-format`:

```bash
cmake --build build --target format
cmake --build build --target fix-format
```

### Building Documentation

Generate and view the documentation:

```bash
cmake -S docs -B build/docs
cmake --build build/docs --target GenerateDocs
open build/docs/doxygen/html/index.html
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to DataMesh! Please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Write clear, concise commit messages.
3. Ensure your code is well-documented and passes all tests.
4. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

## FAQ

**Q: How does the graph-based approach work?**

A: In DataMesh, files and their metadata are represented as nodes in a directed graph. Tags and relationships between files are managed as edges in the graph, allowing for efficient querying and retrieval.

**Q: How does file fragmentation and sharding work?**

A: Files can be fragmented into smaller pieces and distributed across the network. The graph structure helps manage these fragments and their relationships, ensuring that users can retrieve complete files from multiple fragments.

**Q: What are the main benefits of using a graph-oriented approach?**

A: The graph-oriented approach allows for flexible and efficient management of file tags and relationships, supports complex queries, and facilitates scalable distribution and retrieval of fragmented files.

**Q: How do I report issues or bugs?**

A: Please use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/YourOrg/DataMesh/issues) page to report any issues or bugs.
